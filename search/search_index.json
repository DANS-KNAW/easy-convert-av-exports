It is a command line tool that preprocesses bags exported by easy-fedora-to-bag which contain AV materials. The resulting bags are then further processed to deposits by easy-convert-bag-to-deposit and ingested into a Data Station. Processing \u00b6 The input is a directory containing bags exported from EASY by easy-fedora-to-bag . Per dataset one or two bags are exported, depending on whether there was a folder called original in the dataset. The orginal folder contains the original files of the dataset as deposited by the user. This tool completes the second version with the streaming copies of the audio and video files and subtitles, if present. The pseudo-files (empty files that refer to files in the dark archive) are removed. It is envisioned that the files these refer to will be added to the dataset in the Data Station in a later stage. sources: springfieldDir: # ...location of directory containing files from Springfield (streaming copies) path: # ...location of a CSV file detailing where to find the files stagingDir: # ...location of directory where the files are staged The CSV file should have the following format: easy_file_id dataset_id path_in_springfield_dir easy-file:12345 easy-dataset:67890 path/to/file2 easy-file:23456 easy-dataset:67890 path/to/file4 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION \u00b6 Currently, this project is built as an RPM package for RHEL7/CentOS7 and later. The RPM will install the binaries to /opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-convert-av-exports and the configuration files to /etc/opt/dans.knaw.nl/easy-convert-av-exports . Development \u00b6 When running the program with the start.sh script, you must set JAVA_HOME to point to a JDK 8 installation. However, when building the project with Maven, you must set JAVA_HOME to point to a JDK 17 installation. BUILDING FROM SOURCE \u00b6 Prerequisites: Java 8 Maven 3.3.3 or higher RPM Steps: git clone https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/easy-convert-av-exports.git cd easy-convert-av-exports mvn clean install If the rpm executable is found at /usr/local/bin/rpm , the build profile that includes the RPM packaging will be activated. If rpm is available, but at a different path, then activate it by using Maven's -P switch: mvn -Pprm install .","title":"Manual"},{"location":"#easy-convert-av-exports","text":"","title":"easy-convert-av-exports"},{"location":"#synopsis","text":"easy-convert-av-exports [--move] <input-dir> <output-dir>","title":"SYNOPSIS"},{"location":"#description","text":"This project is a rewrite of easy-preprocess-av-bag .
